# Weather Forecast

## Description
Weather Forecast is a website where you can go to see information about the weather. It is super simple to use all you have to do is input a city and press search. After that, you will be directed to information including the current weather and a 5-day forecast. Information like temperature, wind speed, and humidity is also displayed. This information is saved onto your local storage, so when you go back to see more cities, the past citis are still there.
